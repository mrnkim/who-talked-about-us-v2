# Who Talked About Us?

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

As an experienced marketing professional in the beauty industry, I've discovered the value of collaborating with influencers who are genuinely enthusiastic about your brand. These influencers often mention your brand organically, making them prime candidates for partnerships. To streamline the process of identifying such influencers, I created an application called "Who Talked About Us" using the [Twelve Labs API](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/docs). This application enables deep contextual video searches, identifying mentions of your brand in YouTube videos, even if your brand isn't explicitly named in titles or descriptions. Let's delve into how you can build a similar app and leverage the Twelve Labs API for influencer identification

ðŸ“Œ Check out the [Demo](https://who-talked-about-us-vercel-client.vercel.app/)! (_Please note: This is a simplified version of the app_)

## ðŸš˜ How to Use

1. Either create a new index or provide an index ID of the existing index that you already created. You can look up the index IDs by [listing indexes](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/v1.2/reference/list-indexes).

   - This app _only_ supports YouTube videos

2. Once you are inside an index, Begin by uploading videos in bulk to the app using either YouTube [playlist ID](https://www.sociablekit.com/find-youtube-playlist-id/#:~:text=Go%20to%20your%20target%20YouTube,playlist%20ID%20is%20PLFs4vir_WsTwEd%2DnJgVJCZPNL3HALHHpF), [channel ID](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/find-a-youtube-channel-id/), or JSON file.

   - A YouTube playlist and channel should be public
   - The format of a JSON file should follow the below structure

     ```
     [
      { "url": "<VIDEO URL>" },
      { "url": "<VIDEO URL>" }
      ...
     ]
     ```

3. Once the videos are uploaded, you can conduct a search using any keyword. Here are some suggestions:

   - Enter your brand name or product name and discover who's already talking about you in their videos
   - Enter your competitors' brand names to see what types of influencers they're attracting
   - You can also search for very specific or contextual keywords such as "_applying MAC gold highlighter_" or "_holding Gentle Monster sunglasses_"!

4. The search results will be shown grouped by each channel (influencer) and video, displaying moments in videos where your keyword is mentioned or featured.

5. Based on these results, you can prioritize influencers and begin your outreach efforts!
